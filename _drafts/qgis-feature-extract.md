Exploring features in QGIS is really easy when you use the right tool. The trick is knowing what the right tool is. I run through a couple of the available options.

Here are the some ways you might start exploring the data:

1. Identify Features (button)
2. Statistical Summary (panel)
3. Symbology and Labels (layer properties)
4. Python console (panel)
5. Attribute Table (window)

I'll go through the pros and cons of each, but here's a handy table to start:

| Tool             | Pros                                      | Cons                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Identify Features (button) | - Quickly locate specific features on the map <br> - Easy to use | - Limited to identifying features visually <br> - May be less efficient for large datasets |
| Statistical Summary (panel) | - Provides statistical information about data <br> - Helps in understanding data distribution | - Requires some familiarity with statistical concepts <br> - May not be suitable for all types of data |
| Python console (panel) | - Allows for automation and scripting tasks <br> - Offers flexibility in data manipulation | - Requires knowledge of Python programming <br> - Steeper learning curve for beginners |
| Attribute Table (window) | - Comprehensive view of attribute data <br> - Enables sorting and filtering of data | - Can be overwhelming for users with large datasets <br> - Limited visualization capabilities |
